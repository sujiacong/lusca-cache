1.10: - Fix processing of more than 256 queries
      - Send a dummy NAS-Port-Type attribute
      - Documentation cleanup
1.09: - RADIUS protocol fixes by Henrik Nordstrom <hno@squid-cache.org>
      - Corrected how retransmits & timeouts is handled
      - The shared secret now verified properly
      - Request/response processing paired properly
      - New -t command line option to tune the RADIUS timeout
1.08: - RADIUS port/service option by Joost de Heer <sanguis@xs4all.nl>
      - Added service/port tags to the configuration file allowing
	manual override of the RADIUS port number via the config
	file in addition to the already existing -p command line
	option doing the same.
      - The default port used if the radius service could not be found
	in /etc/services changed from the obsolete 1645 to the official
	port 1812
1.07: - Squid-2.5 update by Henrik Nordstrom <hno@squid-cache.org>
	The Basic auth helper communication has changed slightly in
	Squid-2.5 to use URL-encoded strings. This to allow use of "odd"
	characters such as space without problems.
      - Major cleanup to remove dead code and unneeded references to
	RADIUS dictionary files.
      - Added commandline opttions. No more hardcoded paths.
      - Added manpage documentation to document the configuration of this
	helper
1.06: - Included byte-order patch from Klaus Weidner <kw@w-m-p.com>
	The assignment of 'auth->length' erroneously used 'htonl' instead
	of 'htons' to assign a 16-bit value. The symptom was that the radius
	server ignored the requests, because they had zero length according
	to the data header.
      - Initial warnings confused Squid. Most (all) of them now warn to stderr
	so you should see them in the cache.log
      - A fix by Moslem Saleh: A select timeout causes the redirector to skip
	the reply. Moslem detected/fixed this issue on a BSD 4.1 (on Intel)
	system.
1.05a: - Minor fixes and warnings. Should fix some compiler issues (compiler
	 fixes are untested except on Debian Linux 1.3 & GCC-2.95-2)
1.04: - Rolled in patches from Mike McCauley and Andrea Dell'Amico:
	These patches fix a few bugs and make the kit more platform 
	independent. 
	also  fixes:
	Unwanted characters in the reply. This confuses Squid. 
	This is caused by unexpected replies from the RADIUS server 
	and should have been ignored by
	the authenticator; 
	It enables long passwords (up to 254 characters); 
	It allows passwords with embedded spaces. 
	Mike McCauley mikem@open.com.au
	Added Makefile.solaris for Solaris 2.5.1
1.03: - Fixes for Solaris(2.5)
	(UINT4 *)ptr = htonln(nas_ipaddr) causes a coredumps in Solaris.
	This works better:
	  nip=htonl(nas_ipaddr);
	  memcpy(prt, nip, 4)
      - Also portno is changed in this fashion.

1.02: - Pre release (various fixes)
1.01: - various bug fixes
