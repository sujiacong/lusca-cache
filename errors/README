Error Page generation notes


= Overview =

Some (well, "English" at the time of commit) of the error pages are now
beginning to be template generated.

For example, English/ is now empty. Its populated by having the source directory
(src/English/) passed through "build.pl" and written into "English". "make install"
then works normally.

The only template entry at the moment is @STYLE@. This expands to the in-line
style CSS file (defaulting to "error.css".) The resultant combination is written
out into the error directory during "make install".

= How the error page stuff is built =

The configure script populates ERR_LANGUAGES from the errors/error-categories.txt
file. It used to just probe all subdirectories of errors/ and include those which
had an ERR_ACCESS_DENIED page. This won't work in cases where the real error
pages live in src/ and the subdirectory (eg errors/English/) is empty at configure
time.

= TODO =

At least document what the stylesheet entries are so others have a chance of
writing customised error page layouts.

The whole make setup for building and installing error pages is a bit dirty.
Shuffle around the error page directory layout and generate some actual
per-directory Makefile's to do the installation.
